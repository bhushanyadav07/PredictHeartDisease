# PredictHeartDisease
Predicting heart attacks using predictive analysis models of machine Learning like decision tree,logistic regression, Random Forest, KNN.

1. Introduction:
An estimated 17 million people die of CVDs (Cardiovascular disease), particularly heart attacks
and strokes, in the world every year. Cardiac ailments killed more Indians in 2016 (28%) than
any other non-communicable disease, said a new study published in the September 2018 issue
of health journal, The Lancet. These are double the numbers reported in 1990 when heart
disease caused 15% of deaths in India. Today we will try to build a heart attack predictor. Based
on some diagnostically measured parameters we will predict who among the subjects under
consideration, are on high risk of heart attack. This can revolutionize the healthcare system and
help save many many lives.
